## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Conversion Blockers)

#### 1️⃣ Pricing Transparency - NOW VISIBLE
```
✅ Hero section: "Flexible pilot pricing for mid-size firms • Starting at ₹50,000/month"
✅ Final CTA: "Pilot programs from ₹50,000/month • Scale with your firm"
```
**Why this matters**: Removes buyer's #1 friction point - budget uncertainty

---

#### 2️⃣ Hero Subtext - NOW FEATURE-SPECIFIC
```
❌ BEFORE: "streamlines everything from research to drafting"
✅ AFTER: "extracts clauses, flags risks, and tracks obligations"
         → "review contracts 5x faster while maintaining complete control"
```
**Why this matters**: Clarity → Conversion (shows what you actually do)

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT (Professional Standards)

#### 3️⃣ Photo Labels - NOW SCENARIO-DRIVEN
```
❌ Due Diligence          → ✅ During Client Meetings
❌ Contract Negotiation   → ✅ Managing 200+ Contracts  
❌ Regulatory Audit       → ✅ In Audits
```
**Why this matters**: Buyers recognize themselves in scenarios, not process names

---

#### 4️⃣ Security Copy - NOW INDIA-SPECIFIC
```
❌ "International safety and security standards"
✅ "Built for strict confidentiality and compliance of Indian law firms"
✅ "With DPDP-ready architecture" (not just "DPDP compliance")
```
**Why this matters**: Shows deep market understanding + differentiation

---

#### 5️⃣ Navigation - NOW B2B PROFESSIONAL
```
❌ "Our Vision" (consumer-focused)
✅ "Company" (B2B standard)
```
**Why this matters**: Subtle but signals enterprise professionalism

---

#### 6️⃣ Final CTA - NOW BRAND-ALIGNED
```
❌ "Ready to modernize?"
✅ "Ready to work without limits?" 
   (callbacks to hero tagline + clearer benefit)
```
**Why this matters**: Consistency + clarity = better conversion
